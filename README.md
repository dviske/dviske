- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dviske
- I work in the Enterprise Support team here at GitHub!
- When I'm not helping to fix issues and bugs in GitHub and GitHub Enterprise, you can find me working on all manner of random things, such as:
- Random Python software to customize and ease my homelab.
- Electrical Engineering projects
- The occasional open source issue/contribution!
